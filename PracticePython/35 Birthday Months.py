'''
Birthday Months  
Exercise 35 from practicepython.org

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. 
In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

import json
from datetime import datetime
import calendar
from collections import Counter

filename = "names_and_birthdays.json"

with open(filename, "r") as f:
    dict = json.load(f)

months = []
for person in dict:
    date = datetime.strptime(dict[person], "%d/%m/%Y")
    months.append(calendar.month_name[date.month])

c = Counter(months)

print(c)
